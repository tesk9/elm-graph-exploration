# General Approach

1. Isolate distinct graphs
2. For each distinct graph,
  a. Find the point/s with the most edges
  b. Put these points in the center
  c. Work out radially from there, allocating spacing according to number of additional edges

# TODO
- worry about edges cutting across each other
